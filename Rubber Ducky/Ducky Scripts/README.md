# Red Team Adventures - Chapter: USB Rubber Ducky & Ducky Scripts

I had a chance to use and play around with Marcus Mengs's P4wnP1 ALOA Framework during one of my Red Team Adventures.
Kudos to Marcus (@Mame82) for the awesome framework!

This directory contains different Ducky Scripts that I created and used in my Red Team Adventures for payload delivery and execution! :)
